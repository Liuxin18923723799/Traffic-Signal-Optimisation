# Traffic-Signal-Optimisation
Optimization of Traffic Signal Settings in Smart Cities to settle the optimal traffic signal in entire city using MATLAB.

Goals
1. Determine the traffic signal settings to minimize the driverâ€™s average travel time.
2. Achieve the network equilibrium using the settings calculated at the above defined level.
